## Implementation and Application of Graham's Convex Hull algorithm

### GrahamConvexHull.java
Implements Graham's Convex Hull algorithm using linkedlist and stack data structures provided by Java Collection Framework.

### ManualInputPoints.java
Allows users to insert points in the plane and prints (in terminal) vertices of convex hull ordered clockwise starting from minimum ordinate point.

### RandomInputPoints.java
Runs algorithm on different random input sizes and configurations.

### Test.java
Allows to graphically display an instance and a solution of the convex hull problem.
When executed it shows (in a GUI) a set of randomly generated points in the plane and user can view convex hull pressing ENTER key.
